I plan on 

- project deliverables

A working website with the required backend capabilites. 
I am not taking Web Design, so I don't have a clear idea of how much asthetic effort I want to apply,
I would like the site to be somewhat pretty.
Additionally I am taking Computer Graphics w/ Dr. Kruse, which this semester is using WebGL, so maybe some integration for those projects

- project technologies

JavaScript
HTML
CSS
Database of somekind
WebGL?

- learning outcomes

Would like to create functionality of professional websites
Ideally incorporating user logins / accounts + cookies to make them work
